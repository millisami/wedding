# Many thx to Davide D'Agostino (DAddYE)

This LightBox Helper is based on the lastest javascript http://www.stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/

note: this js use Prototype JavaScript framework, version 1.6.0

It's only make an helper, copy the lastest javascripts, css, and images on your public/javascript directory
and register the javascript in the AssetTagHelper of rails,
so for include the javascript in your page you only can add this (if you havn't yet):

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

You must add also the stylesheet so add this on your page head:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'lightwindow' %>

The is very simple for add a LightWindow in your page add this:
<%= lightwindow_link_to(name, options = {}, html_options = {}, *parameters_for_method_reference) %>
es:
<%= lightwindow_link_to(
        "Click me !", {:action => 'edit', :id => "12/"}, :title => "This is a test!",

      ) %>
